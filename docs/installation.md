## Installation

By far the easiest way to try and run neuron-catalog is the demo server at
[oasis.sandstorm.io](https://oasis.sandstorm.io/apps/u1pa4174jqhvn93fkgr6u07mfgpk53dtgvfqqz9hec0pxk6c8nuh).

You can also install and run the Sandstorm Package locally by using the
Sandstorm App Store. Install Sandstorm, and neuron-catalog will be available as
an app.
