Neuron Catalog - A simple web database for keeping track of neurons

Neuron Catalog is a web-based database for small groups (e.g. a lab)
collaborating on neuronal circuit mapping. It provides a simple platform to
organize your notes about driver lines, neuron types, brain regions and putative
connectivity. Each group that wants to run the neuron-catalog can run their own
server, as the software is free and open source (GNU Affero General Public
License v3). Because it is run as an isolated, standalone database, the
neuron-catalog can be used as a collaborative lab-notebook to record novel
observations during the process of discovery. Thus, neuron-catalog complements
large-scale efforts which require extensive curation by providing a
collaboration platform before the data are ready for integration into a curated
database.
